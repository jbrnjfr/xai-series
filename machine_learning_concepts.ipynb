        "2. Select the best feature to split the data, using a criterion like:\n",
        "    - Gini Impurity (default in classification): Measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified.\n",
        "    - Entropy (Information Gain): Measures the uncertainty in a dataset.\n",
        "    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) (for regression): Measures variance reduction.\n",
        "3. Repeat the process recursively until:\n",
        "    - A stopping criterion is met (e.g., max depth reached).\n",

        "1. criterion (Splitting Measure)\n",
        "    - Controls how the decision tree chooses features for splitting.\n",
        "    - \"gini\" → Uses Gini Impurity (default). Measures how impure a node is (lower values are better). Faster and often works well for general cases.\n",
        "    - \"entropy\" → Uses Entropy (Information Gain). Measures information gain (higher values are better). Used if dataset has categorical variables and needs interpretability.\n",
        "2. max_depth (Controls Tree Depth)\n",
        "    - Any integer value (default = None, meaning tree grows fully).\n",
        "    - Limits how deep the tree grows.\n",
        "    - A deep tree captures more details but may overfit.\n",
        "    - A shallow tree prevents overfitting but may be too simple.\n",
        "    - Large datasets → Use a limited depth (e.g., max_depth=5).\n",
